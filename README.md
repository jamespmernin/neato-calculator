# General Assembly Project 2

## Neato Calculator

## Project Description

Using a calculator API with common functionality stored in Airtable, this app will be designed to perform all types of calculations. There will be multiple modes, including standard, scientific, and programming, and the history will keep track of all of your calculations.

## API and Data Sample

[Math.js API](https://api.mathjs.org/)

The following response is given when this GET request is made: `GET http://api.mathjs.org/v4/?expr=2%2F3&precision=3`

`0.667`

#### MVP 

- Have a standard view that does the same basic calculations as the Calculator app on Windows (add, subtract, multiply, divide, square, square root, inverse, percent)
- Have a scientific mode that processes more complex calculations (exponents, factorials, log and ln, absolute value, modulus)
- Have a programmer mode that processes comp sci calculations (bit shift, hexadecimal, octal, binary)

#### PostMVP  

- Add a memory storage and recall system to save results
- Add a history log that will store all calculations

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

Being able to make the code functional will be a strength of mine. My years of programming experience has me used to fixing issues as they come.

### Weaknesses:

CSS is still elusive to me, so I expect to spend a lot of time trying to get this to work. Making use of React functionality and Airtable may also prove challenging.

### Opportunities:

Being able to apply my ability to look up resources if I get stuck will help me get through the hard parts of my code.

### Threats:

My biggest threat is going to be making sure I am not wasting time getting stuck on silly errors and taking too long to try to resolve them.
